    <p>
      Hi!, I grew up normally untill i reached to 6<sup>th</sup> standard.After that i craked the
      <b>JNVST Exam, 2009</b> and I went to JNV Bhopal. After that my life totally changed. Intially everyone
      hates that Novodaya life but as time goes they loves that life and don't wanna leave Novodaya(They came
      crying and they leave crying, but with lots of memory to remember). I also enjoyed that life very much
      and I still miss those days. When I was in 10<sup>th</sup> standard, again i cracked another exam called
      <b>GDST (Grand Dakshana Selection Test), 2014</b> and then i went to the place i miss so much where i
      got the real friends and i spent two memorable years of my life there and that's <b>'JNV Bundi'</b>.
      It's near Kota in Rajasthan. There I meet Naqueeb Ahmad, A boy from Bihar(known for Volleyball). He plays
      good Volleyball. And normal life for some time. Finally I ended up as squad of 4-5 friends Me, Naqueeb,
      Saorabh, Tuddu, Jay Praksh. They are the close ones. <br>
      Now, I get into the IIT Delhi, there also normal life for two years and then I meet Kiran, very nice girl.
      Kiran is friend with Deepika, Nikita and Sonakshi and I meet everyone one by one and then we are a group of
      7-8 friends here at IIT Delhi. And now ther is this lockdown due to this COVID-19 pendemic.
